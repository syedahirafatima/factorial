Factorial Calculator in Python
This is a simple Python program to find the factorial of a given number entered by the user.


Features:
1. Calculates factorial of positive integers.
2. Handles the special case where the number is 0 (factorial is 1).
3. Displays a message if the input number is negative (since factorial is not defined for negative numbers).


How to Run:
1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Download or copy the factorial.py file.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the program:


Example:
Enter a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is 120

Enter a number: -3
Factorial does not exist for negative numbers.


What I Learned:
1. How to use loops (for loop) in Python.
2. How to handle input and output.
3. Basic conditional statements (if-elif-else).
